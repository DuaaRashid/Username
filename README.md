# Username Checking System

## Overview

The Username Checking System is a simple command-line application written in Python that allows users to check the availability of usernames and create accounts if the usernames are available. The application is designed to be user-friendly, offering clear prompts and feedback throughout the process.

## Features

- **Check Username Availability**: Users can input a username to check if it already exists in the system.
- **Case Insensitivity**: The username check is case-insensitive, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Account Creation**: If a username is available, users have the option to create an account with that username.
- **Exit Option**: Users can exit the program at any time by typing 'y'.
